# Not-CNPG PostgreSQL Extensions Container Images

This repository provides **maintenance scripts** for building **immutable
container images** containing PostgreSQL extensions that cannot be accepted
into the upstream [cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers)
project due to licensing constraints, but are otherwise fully compatible with
[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/).

## Documentation

- [Adding a New Extension](./CONTRIBUTING_NEW_EXTENSION.md): A step-by-step
  guide for contributors.
- [Building Locally](./BUILD.md): Technical instructions for the build system
  (Dagger/Task).
- [CloudNativePG Documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/imagevolume_extensions/):
  How to use these images in your cluster.

---

## Requirements

- **CloudNativePG** ≥ 1.27
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 18 (requires the `extension_control_path` feature)
- **Kubernetes** 1.33+ (with [ImageVolume feature enabled in 1.33 and 1.34](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/16/kubernetes-1-31-image-volume-source/))

---

## Supported Extensions

| Extension | Description | Project URL | Maintained by | License blocker |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[pg_cron](pg-cron)** | Cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL | [github.com/citusdata/pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron) | @ardentperf | Vixie-Cron (src/entry.c, src/misc.c) |

Extensions in this repository are not accepted upstream solely due to licensing
— they are otherwise fully functional and meet all other upstream quality
requirements.

---

## Relationship to Upstream

This repository tracks the upstream
[cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers)
build infrastructure as closely as possible. The only intentional differences are:

- Extensions present upstream are removed here (they are maintained there).
- Extensions blocked upstream by licensing are added here.

This keeps merging upstream infrastructure improvements straightforward.

---

## Contribution and Maintenance Policy

Contributors are welcome to propose and maintain additional extensions.

### Governance and Compliance

The project adheres to the following frameworks:

- **Governance Model:** complies with the CloudNativePG (CNPG) Governance
  Model, as defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md).
- **Code of Conduct:** follows the CNCF Code of Conduct, as defined in
  [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Extension Requirements

When proposing a new extension, the following criteria must be met:

- **Licensing:** The extension must have been declined by the upstream
  cloudnative-pg project solely due to a license not on the
  [CNCF Allowlist](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md).
  All other upstream quality requirements still apply.
- **Structure:** only one extension can be included within an extension folder.
- **Debian Packages:** Extension images must be built **exclusively** from
  Debian packages in the `main` component (which by definition complies with
  the [DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)), sourced from
  a trusted, auditable repository.
  The [PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG)](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt)
  is the recommended source, but other Debian repositories are acceptable
  provided they meet the same standards.
- **License inclusion:** all necessary license agreements for the extension and
  its dependencies must be included within the extension folder.

See [Adding a New Extension](./CONTRIBUTING_NEW_EXTENSION.md) for the full
workflow on proposing and submitting a new extension.

### Submission Process

1. **Request and commitment:** Open a new issue requesting the extension.
   The contributor(s) must agree to become "component owners" and maintainers
   for that extension.
2. **Approval:** Maintainers review the proposal and either approve it or
   request changes.
3. **Submission:** Component owner(s) open a Pull Request (PR) to introduce
   the new extension. The PR must include an entry in the `CODEOWNERS` file
   adding the component owner(s) for the new extension folder. The PR is
   reviewed, approved, and merged.
4. **Naming:** The name of the extension is the registry name.

### Removal Policy

If component owners decide to stop maintaining their extension, and no other
contributors are found, the main project maintainers reserve the right to
**unconditionally remove that extension**.

---

## Naming & Tagging Convention

Each extension image tag follows this format:

```
<extension-name>:<ext_version>-<timestamp>-<pg_version>-<distro>
```

**Example:**
Building `pg_cron` version `1.6.7` on PostgreSQL `18.0` for the `trixie`
distro, with build timestamp `202509101200`, results in:

```
pg-cron:1.6.7-202509101200-18-trixie
```

For convenience, **rolling tags** should also be published:

```
pg-cron:1.6.7-18-trixie
pg-cron:1.6.7-18-trixie
```

This scheme ensures:

- Alignment with the upstream `postgres-containers` base images
- Explicit PostgreSQL and extension versioning
- Multi-distro support

---

## Image Labels

Each extension image includes OCI-compliant labels for runtime inspection
and tooling integration. These metadata fields enable CloudNativePG and
other tools to identify the base PostgreSQL version and OS distribution.

### CloudNativePG-Specific Labels

| Label                                 | Description                      | Example                                                 |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.name`    | Base PostgreSQL container image  | `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-bookworm` |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.pgmajor` | PostgreSQL major version         | `18`                                                    |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.os`      | Operating system distribution    | `bookworm`                                              |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.sql.version`  | PostgreSQL extension SQL version | `1.6`                                                   |

### Standard OCI Labels

In addition to CloudNativePG-specific labels, all images include standard OCI
annotations as defined by the [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md):

| Label                                  | Description                 |
|:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| `org.opencontainers.image.created`     | Image creation timestamp    |
| `org.opencontainers.image.version`     | Extension's package version |
| `org.opencontainers.image.revision`    | Git commit SHA              |
| `org.opencontainers.image.title`       | Human-readable image title  |
| `org.opencontainers.image.description` | Image description           |
| `org.opencontainers.image.source`      | Source repository URL       |
| `org.opencontainers.image.licenses`    | License identifier          |

You can inspect these labels using container tools:

```bash
# Using docker buildx imagetools
docker buildx imagetools inspect <image> --raw | jq '.annotations'

# Using skopeo
skopeo inspect docker://<image> | jq '.Labels'
```

## Image catalogs

To simplify the deployment of PostgreSQL extensions, this project automatically
generates `ClusterImageCatalog` resources. These catalogs provide a curated
list of compatible extension images for PostgreSQL 18+ versions.

- **Frequency:** Built once a week.
- **Location:** Published in the [`artifacts`
  project](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/artifacts/tree/main/image-catalogs-extensions).
- **Naming Convention:** These are based on the `minimal` catalog and use the
  `catalog-minimal` prefix (e.g., `catalog-minimal-trixie.yaml`)
