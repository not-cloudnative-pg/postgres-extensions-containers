[pgSphere](https://pgsphere.github.io/) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides spherical geometry data types and operators for astronomical and geographical data. It supports types such as spherical points, circles, ellipses, lines, polygons, and boxes, along with indexing via GiST.

## Usage

### 1. Add the pgsphere extension image to your Cluster

Define the `pgsphere` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section of
your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-pgsphere
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: pgsphere
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-pgsphere
        reference: ghcr.io/not-cloudnative-pg/pgsphere:1.5.2-18-trixie
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `pg_sphere` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource, or by running `CREATE EXTENSION` directly in `psql`. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-pgsphere-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-pgsphere
  extensions:
  - name: pgsphere
    # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-pgsphere extractVersion=^(?<version>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)
    version: '1.5.2'
```
Alternatively, you can enable the extension directly with SQL:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_sphere;
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `pg_sphere` listed among the installed extensions.

## Known Caveats

- **Runtime library dependency**: This extension requires HEALPIX and other
  astronomical libraries at runtime. These are bundled in the image under
  `/system/`.
- **License**: `pgsphere` is GPL-3+, which is why it is hosted in the
  not-cloudnative-pg fork rather than upstream.
