[tds_fdw](https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw) is a PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) that enables PostgreSQL to query Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases using the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol via FreeTDS.

## Usage

### 1. Add the tds-fdw extension image to your Cluster

Define the `tds-fdw` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section of
your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-tds-fdw
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: tds-fdw
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-tds-fdw
        reference: ghcr.io/not-cloudnative-pg/tds-fdw:2.0.5-18-trixie
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `tds_fdw` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource, or by running `CREATE EXTENSION` directly in `psql`. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-tds-fdw-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-tds-fdw
  extensions:
  - name: tds-fdw
    # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-tds-fdw extractVersion=^(?<version>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)
    version: '2.0.5'
```
Alternatively, you can enable the extension directly with SQL:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION tds_fdw;
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `tds_fdw` listed among the installed extensions.

## Known Caveats

- **No live database tested**: The CI tests verify that the extension can be
  created (`CREATE EXTENSION tds_fdw`), but do not test actual connectivity to
  a SQL Server or Sybase instance. Actual foreign table queries require a
  running TDS-compatible database server and proper `CREATE SERVER` /
  `CREATE USER MAPPING` configuration.
- **Runtime library dependency**: The FreeTDS library (`libsybdb5`) is bundled
  in the image under `/system/`.
- **License**: `tds_fdw` itself is PostgreSQL-licensed, but its runtime
  dependency `libsybdb5` (FreeTDS) is LGPL-2+, which is why this extension is
  hosted in the not-cloudnative-pg fork rather than upstream.
