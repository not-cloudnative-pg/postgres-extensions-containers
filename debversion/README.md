[debversion](https://packages.debian.org/postgresql-18-debversion) is a PostgreSQL extension that adds a native `debversion` data type for representing and sorting Debian package version strings according to the Debian versioning algorithm (as defined in Debian Policy).

## Usage

### 1. Add the debversion extension image to your Cluster

Define the `debversion` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section of
your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-debversion
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: debversion
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-debversion
        reference: ghcr.io/not-cloudnative-pg/debversion:1.2.0-18-trixie
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `debversion` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource, or by running `CREATE EXTENSION` directly in `psql`. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-debversion-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-debversion
  extensions:
  - name: debversion
    # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-debversion extractVersion=^(?<version>\d+\.\d+)
    version: '1.2'
```
Alternatively, you can enable the extension directly with SQL:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION debversion;
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `debversion` listed among the installed extensions.
