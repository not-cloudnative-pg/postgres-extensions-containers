[pg_uuidv7](https://github.com/fboulnois/pg_uuidv7) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides functions for generating and working with UUID version 7 (UUIDv7) identifiers. UUIDv7 is a time-sortable UUID format that embeds a Unix timestamp, making it more suitable than UUID v4 for use as database primary keys.

## Usage

### 1. Add the pg-uuidv7 extension image to your Cluster

Define the `pg-uuidv7` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section of
your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-pg-uuidv7
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: pg-uuidv7
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-pg-uuidv7
        reference: ghcr.io/not-cloudnative-pg/pg-uuidv7:1.7.0-18-trixie
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `pg_uuidv7` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource, or by running `CREATE EXTENSION` directly in `psql`. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-pg-uuidv7-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-pg-uuidv7
  extensions:
  - name: pg-uuidv7
    # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-pg-uuidv7 extractVersion=^(?<version>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)
    version: '1.7'
```
Alternatively, you can enable the extension directly with SQL:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_uuidv7;
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `pg_uuidv7` listed among the installed extensions. You can then
generate a UUIDv7 with:

```sql
SELECT uuid_generate_v7();
```
